/**
 * 

A thesaurus contains words and synonyms for each word. Below is an example of a data structure that defines a thesaurus:

array("buy" => array("purchase"), "big" => array("great", "large"))

Implement the function getSynonyms, which accepts a word as a string and returns all synonyms for that word in JSON format, as in the example below.

For example, the call $thesaurus->getSynonyms("big") should return:

'{"word":"big","synonyms":["great", "large"]}'

while a call with a word that doesn't have synonyms, like $thesaurus->getSynonyms("agelast") should return:

'{"word":"agelast","synonyms":[]}'
